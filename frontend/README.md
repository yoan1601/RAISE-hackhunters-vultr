# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Frontend Pod Update Explanation

During the deployment, the frontend pods were initially running an older Docker image tagged with a previous commit SHA. This happened because the frontend deployment had not been updated to use the latest image built from the most recent commit.

## What was done?

- The frontend Docker image was rebuilt and pushed with the latest commit SHA tag.
- The Kubernetes frontend deployment was updated to reference this new image tag.
- A rolling update was triggered, causing Kubernetes to replace the old pods with new ones using the updated image.

## Commands used

Assuming the latest commit SHA is stored in the variable `COMMIT_SHA`, the following commands were executed:

    kubectl set image deployment/frontend-deployment frontend=ghcr.io/yoan1601/frontend:${COMMIT_SHA}
    kubectl rollout status deployment/frontend-deployment


These commands update the frontend deployment to use the new image tagged with `${COMMIT_SHA}` and wait until the rollout completes successfully.

## Result

- Frontend pods now run the Docker image built from the latest commit.
- The frontend application serves the updated code and assets.
- This ensures consistency between the deployed frontend and backend components.

## Key Takeaway

Always ensure that Kubernetes deployments explicitly reference the correct, updated image tags after each build to avoid running outdated versions in your cluster.
